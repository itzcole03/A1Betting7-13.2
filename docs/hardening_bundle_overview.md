- **`tests/performance/`** - Performance benchmarking tests
- Comprehensive coverage including unit, integration, and performance testing

### 7. Metrics & Monitoring
- **`backend/services/metrics/metric_keys_reference.py`** - Centralized metric key management
- Prevents metric cardinality explosions and ensures consistent naming

## Integration Notes

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Deploy feature flags configuration
2. Implement calibration schema extensions
3. Set up metric key management

### Phase 2: Edge Hardening
1. Deploy confidence anomaly detector
2. Implement retirement attribution
3. Integrate with existing edge calculation pipeline

### Phase 3: Experimental & Monitoring
1. Deploy A/B testing frameworks
2. Implement integrity monitoring
3. Set up dashboard and alerting

### Key Benefits
- **Reliability**: Automated anomaly detection and retirement attribution
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and delta reporting
- **Experimentation**: Controlled A/B testing for edge improvements
- **Maintainability**: Feature-flag controlled rollout and centralized metrics

## Deployment Guidelines

1. **Feature Flags First**: Deploy feature flags with all features disabled initially
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable features incrementally using feature flags
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Watch for anomalies during each phase deployment
4. **Validate Tests**: Run comprehensive test suites before production deployment

## Dependencies

- Existing edge calculation system
- Unified logging and metrics infrastructure
- Database schema for calibration data storage
- Dashboard infrastructure for monitoring visualization
