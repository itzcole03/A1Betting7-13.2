# Model Promotion Pipeline

## Objective
Ensure only strictly beneficial model versions (accuracy or latency) are promoted to active production usage.

## Promotion Criteria

### Performance Requirements
1. **Accuracy Improvement**: New model must demonstrate statistically significant accuracy improvement
   - Minimum improvement threshold: 2% over baseline
   - Statistical significance: p-value < 0.05 (A/B test)
   - Sustained performance over minimum evaluation period (7 days)

2. **Latency Requirements**: New model must not degrade latency beyond acceptable thresholds
   - Maximum inference time: 500ms (95th percentile)
   - Maximum batch processing time: 2000ms per batch
   - Memory usage within 20% of previous version

3. **Stability Requirements**: New model must demonstrate stable performance
   - No accuracy degradation > 1% over 48-hour period
   - Error rate < 0.1% during evaluation period
   - Successful processing of edge cases and anomalous data

### Evaluation Methodology

#### Stage 1: Shadow Deployment (72 hours)
- Deploy model in shadow mode alongside production model
- Compare predictions on live data without affecting user experience
- Collect performance metrics and accuracy comparisons
- Automated rollback if critical issues detected

#### Stage 2: Canary Deployment (7 days)
- Route 5% of production traffic to new model
- Monitor key performance indicators:
  - Prediction accuracy vs ground truth
  - Latency percentiles (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)
  - Error rates and exception handling
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU)

#### Stage 3: Blue/Green Deployment (24 hours)
- Route 50% of traffic to new model
- Conduct statistical significance testing
- Monitor business metrics:
  - Edge success rate
  - Portfolio performance
  - User satisfaction metrics

#### Stage 4: Full Deployment
- Promote to 100% traffic if all criteria met
- Establish new baseline for future comparisons
- Archive previous model version for rollback capability

## Promotion Gates

### Automated Gates
1. **Performance Gate**: Automated metrics evaluation
   - Accuracy threshold: > baseline + 2%
   - Latency threshold: < 500ms (95th percentile)
   - Error rate: < 0.1%

2. **Stability Gate**: Time-based evaluation
   - No degradation over 48-hour window
   - Consistent performance across different data distributions
   - Successful handling of production load

3. **Resource Gate**: Infrastructure compatibility
   - Memory usage within limits
   - CPU utilization sustainable
   - Compatible with existing infrastructure

### Manual Gates
1. **Business Impact Review**: Manual evaluation of business metrics
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of potential negative impacts
3. **Stakeholder Approval**: Final sign-off from relevant teams

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Accuracy drop > 5% from baseline
- Error rate > 1% 
- Latency increase > 100% from baseline
- Memory usage > 150% of allocation

### Manual Rollback Process
1. Immediate traffic routing to previous version
2. Root cause analysis of performance degradation
3. Issue documentation and remediation planning
4. Re-evaluation before next promotion attempt

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring
- Prediction accuracy tracking
- Latency monitoring with percentile breakdowns
- Error rate and exception tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Critical**: Accuracy drop > 3%, Latency > 1000ms, Error rate > 0.5%
- **Warning**: Accuracy drop > 1%, Latency > 750ms, Error rate > 0.2%

## Model Versioning Strategy

### Version Naming Convention
- Format: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}_{timestamp}`
- Example: `v2.1.0_20250818_142000`

### Model Metadata Tracking
- Training dataset version and characteristics
- Hyperparameter configuration
- Training metrics and validation results
- Infrastructure requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Edge Confidence Integration
- New models inherit existing edge confidence evaluation
- Confidence scores recalibrated for new model characteristics
- Historical performance tracking maintained across versions

### Optimizer Integration
- Seamless integration with edge weighting optimizer
- Performance characteristics automatically incorporated
- Portfolio optimization parameters adjusted for new model

### Calibration Integration
- Model-specific calibration parameters
- Prop-type calibration inheritance with adjustment factors
- Historical calibration data migration strategies

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Model Accuracy**: Prediction accuracy vs ground truth
2. **Business Performance**: Edge success rate, portfolio returns
3. **Operational Metrics**: Latency, error rates, resource usage

### Secondary Metrics  
1. **User Experience**: Response times, system availability
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Resource utilization, infrastructure costs
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Model complexity, debugging difficulty

## Documentation Requirements
