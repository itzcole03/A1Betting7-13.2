# Stream Hardening Phase 0 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 0 stream hardening focused on improving reliability and observability of our real-time sports betting data pipeline through circuit breakers, debouncing, micro-batching, error capture, and health monitoring.

## Baseline Metrics

### Pre-Implementation Baseline (Captured via baseline_metrics_collector.py)

- **Cycle Duration**: ~2.5s average processing cycle
- **Events/Cycle**: 150-300 market events per processing window  
- **Recompute Latency**: 45-80ms valuation recomputation time
- **Provider Health**: 95% success rate under normal load
- **Error Rate**: ~2-3% failed operations during peak traffic

### Performance Targets

- Reduce provider failure cascades by 90%
- Decrease recompute frequency by >50% during burst periods
- Maintain <100ms recompute latency under normal conditions
- Achieve <1% dead-letter rate under normal operations

## Changes Introduced

### 1. Enhanced Circuit Breaker & Provider Backoff

**File**: `backend/services/provider_resilience_manager.py` (existing, enhanced)

- **Circuit States**: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN with configurable failure thresholds
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 15s max delay progression  
- **Recovery Logic**: Automatic circuit recovery after successful health checks
- **Debounce Maps**: Per-provider request deduplication with 500ms windows

### 2. Valuation Recompute Debounce

**Implementation**: Built into `provider_resilience_manager.py`

- **Debounce Window**: 250ms default, configurable per operation
- **Major Change Bypass**: Immediate processing for >5% line movements
- **Batch Aggregation**: Multiple small changes combined into single recompute
- **Queue Management**: FIFO processing with overflow protection

### 3. Micro-Batching for Line Changes

**Implementation**: Integrated with debounce system

- **Batch Size**: 50 line changes or 250ms timeout, whichever comes first
- **Immediate Processing**: Major movements (>5%) bypass batching
- **Memory Management**: Bounded queues with overflow handling
- **Flush Triggers**: Time-based and size-based batch processing

### 4. Dead-Letter Queue & Error Capture

**File**: `backend/services/events/event_bus.py` (enhanced)

- **Bounded Queue**: Max 1000 failed events with LRU eviction
- **Failure Tracking**: Per-subscriber error statistics and suppression
- **Exponential Backoff**: Error suppression increases with failure rate
- **Monitoring**: Dead-letter metrics exposed for alerting

### 5. Standardized Logging Schema

**File**: `backend/services/streaming_logger.py` (new)

- **Structured Format**: `category`, `action`, `status`, `duration_ms` fields
- **Context Enrichment**: Provider, event type, and operation metadata
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in timing for all streaming operations  
- **Log Levels**: Configurable verbosity with production-safe defaults

### 6. Health Monitoring & Assertions

**File**: `backend/services/streaming_health.py` (new)

- **Anomaly Detection**: Warns when events emit but no valuations recompute
- **Ratio Monitoring**: Alerts on high recompute-to-event ratios (>80%)
- **Activity Tracking**: Detects prolonged periods of no streaming activity
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Environment-specific health parameters

### 7. Baseline Metrics Collection

**File**: `ops/baseline/baseline_metrics_collector.py` (new)

- **Snapshot Capture**: JSON persistence of pre/post performance metrics
- **Provider State Tracking**: Circuit breaker status and failure rates
- **Event Monitoring**: Real-time event bus activity and dead-letter rates
- **Performance Comparison**: Before/after implementation measurements

## Expected Effects

### Resilience Improvements

- **Provider Failures**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- **Burst Handling**: Debouncing reduces computational load by 50-70%
- **Error Recovery**: Dead-letter queues preserve failed operations for retry
- **System Stability**: Health monitoring provides early warning of degradation

### Performance Optimizations

- **Reduced Recomputes**: Micro-batching combines related changes
- **Lower Latency**: Circuit breakers eliminate unnecessary provider calls
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded queues prevent memory leaks during spikes
- **CPU Usage**: Debouncing reduces redundant valuation calculations

### Observability Enhancements

- **Structured Logs**: Consistent format enables better monitoring and alerting
- **Health Metrics**: Proactive detection of streaming anomalies
