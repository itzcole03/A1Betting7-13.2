Title: EV enrichment for prediction responses

Summary:
- Adds EV computation and enrichment to consolidated prediction responses when request includes market odds.
- Adds helper functions in `backend/routes/consolidated_ml.py`:
  - `_extract_decimal_odds_from_request(request)`
  - `_maybe_add_ev_to_unified(request, unified_result)`
- Uses `backend.services.ev_service.compute_ev` for EV calculation (supports decimal and American odds).
- Ensures enrichment is defensive (wrapped in try/except and doesn't block prediction return on failure).
- Adjusts router/middleware handling so consolidated ML routes receive `/api/v2/ml/predict` requests (avoids legacy middleware short-circuiting).
- Adds unit tests: `tests/backend/test_ev_helpers.py` (3 tests) and integration test `tests/backend/test_ev_enrichment.py`.
- Adds `backend/EV_API_README.md` documenting the new fields: `odds_decimal`, `ev`, `ev_pct`, `ev_label`.

Files changed (high-level):
- Modified: `backend/core/app.py`, `backend/routes/consolidated_ml.py`, multiple support files
- Added: `backend/EV_API_README.md`, `backend/routes/ev_routes.py`, `backend/services/ev_service.py`, tests under `tests/backend/` (ev_*)

Test evidence (local run):
- Ran `pytest tests/backend` -> 160 passed, 1 failed, 1766 warnings
- Failure: `tests/backend/test_health_endpoints.py::test_legacy_health_endpoint_deprecated` â€” KeyError: 'deprecated'. This appears unrelated to EV changes and may be a pre-existing health envelope expectation mismatch. All EV-related tests passed:
  - `tests/backend/test_ev_helpers.py` -> 3 passed
  - `tests/backend/test_ev_enrichment.py` -> 1 passed
  - `tests/backend/test_ev_service.py` -> passed

Notes / Next steps:
- Investigate the failing health endpoint test; likely due to a missing 'deprecated' flag in the health response envelope.
- Optionally run full test suite and fix health test if it's caused by recent global changes.
- Push branch and open PR in repository; CI will run full checks.
