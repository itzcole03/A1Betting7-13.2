Notes:
- Local test summary: `pytest tests/backend` -> 160 passed, 1 failed (health endpoint deprecated flag). All EV-related tests passed.
- If you want me to update the health endpoint test or investigate that failure before merging, tell me and I'll run the failing test locally and propose a fix.
