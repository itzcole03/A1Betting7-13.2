## 🎉 Platform Status: Production Ready

The A1 Betting Platform has successfully transformed from a collection of specialized components into a unified, professional-grade betting intelligence ecosystem. With **95+ integrated features**, **advanced AI capabilities**, **comprehensive risk management**, and **enterprise-grade admin controls**, the platform provides users with institutional-quality tools for sports betting analysis and automation.

**Last Updated**: Current Session
**Version**: 2.0.0 (Post-Consolidation)
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready with Active Development

## Health & Diagnostics Banner

The app now features a persistent health/diagnostics banner at the top of the main window. This banner shows:

- **Backend connection status** (healthy, error, stale)
- **Last analysis result** (number of opportunities found, data source, timestamp)
- **Analysis errors** (if any)

### How to Use
- If you see 🟢 Backend Healthy, the backend is running and connected.
- If you see 🔴 Backend Error, check that the backend server is running and your network is working.
- If you see 🟡 Backend Stale, data may be outdated.
- After running an analysis, the banner will show the number of opportunities found, the data source (live/fallback/mock), and the time of the last analysis.
- If analysis fails, a red error banner will appear with the error message.

### Troubleshooting
- If the banner shows Backend Error, try restarting the backend server.
- If analysis results are not updating, try refreshing the page or running analysis again.
- For further help, contact the development team with a screenshot of the banner and any error messages.
