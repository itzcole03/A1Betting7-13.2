# Development Prompts for A1Betting7-13.2

These prompts are designed to guide a VS Code Copilot agent in implementing, completing, or enhancing features within the A1Betting7-13.2 repository, based on the analysis of top props betting tools and feature integration.

## Props.Cash Integration Ideas

### Feature: Enhanced Data Visualization and Filtering

**Context:** The `frontend/src/pages/PerformanceChartsDemo.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/PredictionsDashboard.tsx` files indicate existing charting capabilities. The goal is to enhance these visualizations to emulate Props.Cash's interactive charts and filters, specifically for displaying player performance versus betting lines and aggregating odds data.

**Prompt:**
```
As a React developer, enhance the data visualization components in `frontend/src/pages/PerformanceChartsDemo.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/PredictionsDashboard.tsx`. Implement interactive charts (using Chart.js or D3.js if not already in use) that display player's recent performances against their betting lines. Integrate filtering capabilities to allow users to sort and view data by various parameters (e.g., last 5/10 games, head-to-head matchups). Ensure these visualizations are dynamic and update with real-time data. Consider creating reusable chart components in `frontend/src/components/`.
```

### Feature: Real-time Odds Aggregation and Line Shopping

**Context:** The `backend/api_integration.py` and `backend/statcast_api.py` files handle sports data API integration. The objective is to expand this to aggregate live odds from multiple sportsbooks (e.g., Sportradar, theOddsAPI) to enable line-shopping functionality similar to Props.Cash.

**Prompt:**
```
As a Python backend developer, extend the odds aggregation logic in `backend/api_integration.py` to pull live odds from multiple sports APIs (e.g., Sportradar, theOddsAPI). Implement robust data parsing and storage mechanisms to handle real-time odds updates. Create new API endpoints or modify existing ones to expose this aggregated odds data to the frontend. Ensure efficient data retrieval and minimal latency. Consider implementing cron jobs or webhooks to fetch fresh odds and stats periodically and store them in the database.
```

### Feature: High-Value 


“Outlier” Bet Identification (EV Calculation)

**Context:** The current codebase lacks explicit functionality for identifying high-value 


bets based on Expected Value (EV). This feature is crucial for providing users with actionable insights. The `backend/prediction_engine.py` and `backend/arbitrage_engine.py` are the most likely places to implement this logic.

**Prompt:**
```
As a Python backend developer, implement a feature to identify and tag high-value “outlier” bets based on their Expected Value (EV) percentage. Within `backend/prediction_engine.py` or a new dedicated module, develop a robust EV calculation model that compares our internal projections with market odds. Create a mechanism to flag bets with a positive EV and expose this information through an API endpoint. This will be consumed by the frontend to highlight these valuable betting opportunities to the user.
```
